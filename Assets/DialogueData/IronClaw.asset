  dialogue:
  - Ironclaw... so they finally put a face to the whispers. The 'Ghost of Broken
    Hill,' they call him. Fast, ruthless, and always one step ahead. But even a ghost
    can bleed.
  - "Five million. Guess the city\u2019s willing to pay a fortune to clean its hands
    of him. Too bad they\u2019ll never see it spent. This isn't about money for me."
  - "Hah. A message? Or a warning? Either way, I\u2019m coming for you, Ironclaw.
    Let\u2019s see how your claws match up against mine."
  - Question remains, should I hunt Ironclaw now or should I chill?
