  dialogue:
  - "Well, well... there you are. The Jokers. Hyenas. A trio of laughter and pain,
    huh? 'Dead or alive, beware.' Yeah, I\u2019ve heard enough about your resurrection
    trick. It won\u2019t save you this time."
  - "They say 'dead or alive,' but I don\u2019t care much for the alive part. I\u2019ll
    take what\u2019s left of you back to the underground for a final laugh. Those
    taunts and tricks won\u2019t save you from me."
